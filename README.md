# BBP Animation

Dear reader,

This is the source code used to generate the following video: https://youtu.be/RoE2rEwIOis

OSPVRay is used for rendering.

The project builds with Visual Studio 2019 16.4.2 (sorry no Linux makefile yet!)

To compile properly, OSPVray binaries and sources need to be present in the same root directory

```
+-+- bbp_anim / bbp_anim.vcxproj
  +- ospray
  +- ospray-1.8.5.windows
```

Enjoy!

Olivier
